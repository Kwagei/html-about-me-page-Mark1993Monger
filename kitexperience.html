    <p><font size="5" face="cursive"> <b><font color="orangered">K <font color="black">I</font> T</font></b>  is a School of Excellence in Software Engieer.  <br>
        They are involve in Training and Developing of Software <br> for  School, 
         Entity and Organization. <br> <br> I am currently studying computer software Engineering at <br>
          KIT, where I had series of Experiences, some of these <br> experiences  are; as following:
    
        
        </font></p>
        <ol><font size="5"><li><h3>Time:
         </h3></li></font>
         <p><font size="4"> They value time so much and they don't entertain students coming to school
            late. At KIT where they show you a <br>. 
            specific time to be at the school, you have to be on time. <br>

            <li><h3>100% Excellence:</h3>
                <p>They believe excellent in all the marks whenever test is given to you, 
                    which meaning, you study everyday both <br>
                     hands on and reading as well. For Examples: if they give test or quiz that worth
                     100 or 20 points, you give them 20/20. <br> Below 20, you fail, so it challenges.
                     

                </p></li>

                <li><h3>Good Relationship with Students and Lecturers: </h3>
                    <p>KIT having good teaching system, meaning, if you for any reason you the student
                        you are having <br> in the course, just ask them at anytime they always there to help you out.
